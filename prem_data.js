    analysisInsight: 'Q4 (a candle flame as a standalone, non-comparison point source) was answered CORRECTLY - this closes out the three-unit remediation arc that started with U13&#39;s fail (backwards on both comparison and standalone framings), continued through U14&#39;s partial fix (comparison-only), and is now fully resolved with a working standalone recall too. Competition paper&#39;s Q10 is now classified as FULLY confirmed closed. The two misses were unrelated to each other: Q9 (oil poured on water - which floats) was answered in the wrong direction, the THIRD confirmed instance of a recurring fast-read MORE/LESS-style inversion pattern (after U6&#39;s Q7 and U10&#39;s Q7) - the fix is coaching Prem to say the relationship out loud before answering these. Q16 (a helium balloon rising through air, generalising the float/sink rule to gases) was missed because that generalisation was only ever taught via a short supplementary teaching note, never given its own practice question - an undertrained-content gap, not a reasoning failure. Both Competition Q29 (same-volume-ranking) and Q19 (density-prediction) question styles were answered correctly, confirming those two gaps are also closed.',
