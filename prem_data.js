    analysisInsight: 'The "Quick Fix from Unit 18" screen plus 2 embedded test recap questions (Q3 standalone-definition, Q7 moving-object transformation) were BOTH answered correctly - covering exactly the two framings that tripped U18&#39;s fail, on the FIRST remediation attempt, faster than the three-unit arc the analogous U13 light-source inversion needed. Competition Q3 (hydroelectric power, gravitational PE&rarr;KE) is now CONFIRMED CLOSED. Separately, two misses (Q15, Q19) reveal a NEW, internally consistent tide-frequency misconception: Prem currently believes there is only ONE tide cycle per day (one high, one low, ~12 hours apart), when in fact there are roughly TWO of each (same-type tides ~12 hours apart, opposite-type ~6 hours apart) - despite the lesson&#39;s own tides diagram explicitly stating this. The fact was taught but didn&#39;t transfer to applied/predictive reasoning on first exposure. Competition Q30 (tides) is therefore NOT yet confirmed closed - flagged as the priority item for Unit 20&#39;s Gap-Closure Checkpoint, which opens with a dedicated tide-frequency refresher before the review test. One isolated miss (Q4, a snow-vs-sleet bare recall slip) - not part of a pattern.',

Test `Tests\\Unit_20_Test_GapClosureCheckpoint.html` (20Q, 4A/6B/10C, PASS_BAR 16/20, gold/amber Milestone-style theme) re-tests 13 Competition gap items with entirely fresh scenarios: Q9 (sound), Q3 (hydroelectric PE/KE), Q2/Q17 (materials), Q10 (umbra/penumbra), Q29 (density), Q14/Q7 (pollution/nitrogen), Q31/Q32 (germination/flower), Q13/Q19 (observation-vs-inference, 2 questions), and Q30 (tides, weighted heaviest at 3 questions per the priority directive). Built and verified under the ANSWER-BALANCE RULE (5/5/5/5 position spread, zero margin violations) and a zero-overlap Jaccard check against all 16 relevant lesson files AND all 8 prior units&#39; own test questions (160 questions checked). A mandatory 10-year-old role-play pass caught one real physics bug (a density question with a physically impossible sink/float premise, contradicting U15&#39;s own taught oil-is-less-dense-than-water fact) and two refresher-question near-duplicates against the test&#39;s own tide questions - all fixed.
